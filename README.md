# Titled Opens 

### Discover Chess Openings

Titled Opens is all about discovering and exploring different chess openings! We provide our users with the ability to see all of the openings played by any registered Chess.com member. Furthermore, our users will be able to filter for specific types of openings played by any individual member. With our analysis, people will be able to learn the most and least successful openings of anyone on the Chess.com website. We also have a Stats page that will display the most played openings of the current month by users with the titles Grandmaster, International Master, Nation Master, and FIDE Master.

TitledOpens is built with ReactJS and the Chess.com Published Data API.
